In this post, I would like to share my recent experience in a project that failed miserably, mainly due to negligence of the "Individuals and their Interactions" principle.

The first principle of the agile manifesto stresses focus on "Individuals and their Interactions" but unfortunately there is this misconception that this simply means more irrelevant meetings and hollow speeches. I am a big believer that a good agile team must be built on respect, trust and transparency and that communication problems will considerably slow the project and could potentially lead to outright projects' failure if not tackled swiftly.

In my humble opinion, "Individuals and their Interactions" means:
- everyone's opinion counts regardless of titles and experience
- honesty when communicating with all members of the team all the time - not just a select few
- transparency in all decisions and actions
- all members share a goal and work towards that goal
- team fosters contructive criticism and positive conflict
- all members are expected to defend and help the team

Our team lacked in several of these points, which lead to division within the team. There was an insane amount of politics in play and the team lost sight of its goal and stopped functioning as a unit. The team was fractured and groups within the team started pursuing different goals.

Management interfered with the team and try to force their ideas. Any team member that expressed an opinion that did not agree with theirs was labelled diruptive and negative. This meant that team members we afraid to voice their concerns and, therefore, the team missed opportunities to improve, individuals were frustrated but suffering in silence, morale dropped and productivity suffered as a consequence. This also created a toxic environment and divisions within the team.

The product team decided to shield the developers from the business, which is sensible as you do not want your development team to be constantly be interrupted and mess with their flow. However, the development team should not be kept in a silo, completely cut-off from the outside world. The team still needs to know the decisions that are being made and the deliverables being promised as there input is invaluable when determining feasibility. In this particular project, we later discovered that the product team were making dishonest claims about the state of the project, the commitments and deliverables. That, understandably, had a negative effect on the team as it dealt a great blow to the trust the team had for the product owners.

There was no sense of team when it came to product owners, they failed to recognize how they fit in an agile team and started taking the mantle of old school project managers. They stopped discussing the direction of the product with the development team and started making decision and coming up with solutions within themselves. The relationship became akin to parents ordering their children what to do and how. This, naturally, lead to, among other things, another colossal time waste as they came up with technically unfeasible solutions that the development team, to put it mildly picked enormous holes in. Technical people are hired to solve technical problems, therefore, it is crucial that POs present these problems to the team and give them developers ownership of the solutions. This does not mean that the POs should not be involved, it just emphasise that the POs should not provide solutions but engage the team in the technical problems they are trying to resolve. Spotify, for example, recognises this and they simple present the problems to the teams, which have complete control of how to fix it. Basically, people should be allowed to do the jobs they were hired to do.

Additionally, there were at least three different product owners in the team. One operated behind the scenes while the other two were on completely different pages. The team was getting mixed expectations and ever changing goals. This was so bad that it got to a stage where both were not sure what they want from the team and both pushing the team into completely opposite directions. Time was wasted navigating blind alleys and chasing dead-ends.
