title: Planning and Estimations are a waste

I have just come out of a planning meeting that I thought was a complete waste of time. We spend a full hour trying to estimate roughly how many days a number of user stories take and comparing the total to capacity days in order to work out what we can commit to in this sprint. Bearing in mind that these storied we already estimated in complexity points, it just seemed like a complete waste to attempt to re-estimate it again but in days.

I am not a fan of estimation in general and time based estimations in particular. I have seen it been abused so many times that I no longer think it should be used. Additionally, estimations are just that, an estimation - a guess based on what you know about the user story at the time of planning/grooming, which is, most of the time, not much at all. Mostly when I raise this concern, I get the "let's get better at estimation then, shall we?" Why? surely that time is better off spent delivering value to customers. Almost every team I have worked for loses focus of, to me, the biggest benefit you should get from being agile: delivering value. What is value? value is whatever you want.
