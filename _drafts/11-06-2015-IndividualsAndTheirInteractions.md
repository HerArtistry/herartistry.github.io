However, a lot of agile practitioners out there forget that in order of agile to work effectively, transparency should be considered a two-way street. The team was never united but this was mainly because the product owners decided not to share many decisions with the rest of the team. We were taken by surprise during demos and other meeting with decisions and commitments that were made without the consensus of the team. The first of the agile manifestos stresses focus on "Individuals and their Interactions" but unfortunately there is this misconception that this simply means more irrelevant meetings and hollow speeches. I am a big believer that a good agile team must be built on respect, trust and transparency and that communication problems will considerably slow the project and could potentially lead to outright projects failure if not tackled swiftly.

> Studies of "communication saturation" during one project showed that, when no communication problems exist, teams can perform 50 times better than the industry average. Jeff Sutherland

In my humble opinion, "Individuals and their Interactions" means:
- everyone's opinion counts regardless of titles and positions
- honesty when communicating with all members of the team not just a select few
- transparency in all decisions and actions
- all members will defend and help the team
- all members share a goal and work towards that goal
- team fosters contructive criticism and positive conflict

Our team lacked in several of these points, which lead to division within the team that the product owners fed on to push their own agenda. There was an insane amount of politics in play and the team lost sight of its goal and stopped functioning as a unit. The team was fractured and groups within the team started having different goals.

Additionally, there were at least three different product owners in the team. On operated behind the scenes while the other two were on completely different pages. The team was getting mixed expectations and ever changing goals. This was so bad that it got to a stage where both were not sure what they want from the team and both pushing the team into completely opposite directions. Time was wasted navigating blind alleys and chasing dead-ends. 

There was no sense of team when it came to product owners, they failed to recognize how they fit in an agile team and started taking the mantle of old school project managers. They stopped discussing the direction of the product with the development team and started making decision and coming up with solutions within themselves. The relationship became akin to parents ordering their children what to do and how.This, naturally, lead to, among other things, another collosal time waste as they came up with technically unfeasible solutions that the development team, to put it mildly picked enormous holes in. Technical people are hired to solve technical problems, therefore, it is crucial that POs present these problems to the team and give them developers ownership of the solutions. This does not mean that the POs should not be involved, it just emphasise that the POs should not provide solutions but engage the team in the technical problems they are trying to resolve. Spotify, for example, recognises this and they simple present the problems to the teams, which have complete control of how to fix it. Basically, people should be allowed to do the jobs they were hired to do.
