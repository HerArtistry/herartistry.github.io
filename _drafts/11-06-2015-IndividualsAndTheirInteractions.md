In this post, I would like to share my recent experience in a project that failed miserably, mainly due to negligence of the "Individuals and their Interactions" principle.

The first principle of the agile manifesto stresses focus on "Individuals and their Interactions" but unfortunately there is this misconception that this simply means more irrelevant meetings and hollow speeches. I am a big believer that a good agile team must be built on respect, trust and transparency and that communication problems will considerably slow the project and could potentially lead to outright projects' failure if not tackled swiftly.

> Studies of "communication saturation" during one project showed that, when no communication problems exist, teams can perform 50 times better than the industry average. Jeff Sutherland

In my humble opinion, "Individuals and their Interactions" means:
- everyone's opinion counts regardless of titles and experience
- honesty when communicating with all members of the team all the time - not just a select few
- transparency in all decisions and actions
- all members share a goal and work towards that goal
- team fosters contructive criticism and positive conflict
- all members are expected to defend and help the team

Our team lacked in several of these points, which had a detrimental effect on the project and the team. In the rest of this post I will examine the above points and describe how not sticking to them affected the project.

#### Opinions Count
Management interfered with the team and tried to force their ideas. Any team member that expressed an opinion that did not agree with theirs was labelled diruptive and negative. This meant that team members were afraid to voice their concerns and, therefore, the team missed opportunities to improve, individuals were frustrated but suffering in silence, morale dropped and productivity suffered as a consequence.

#### Honesty
The team was shielded from the business, which is sensible as you do not want your development team to be constantly interrupted and mess with their flow. However, the development team should not be kept in a silo, completely cut-off from the outside world. The team still needs to know the decisions that are being made and the deliverables being promised as there input is invaluable when determining feasibility. Furthermore, this helps maintaining the focu of the team. In this particular project, we later discovered that the product team were were econimical with the truth about the state of the project, the commitments and deliverables. That, understandably, had a negative effect on the team as it dealt a great blow to the trust the team had for the product owners. This started a downward spiral that lead to a complete breakdown in communication between the team and product owners.

#### A Shared Goal
This project had at least three different product owners. One operated behind the scenes while the other two were on completely different pages. The team was getting mixed expectations and ever changing goals. This was so bad that it got to a stage where both were not sure what they want from the team and both pushing the team into completely opposite directions. Time was wasted navigating blind alleys and chasing dead-ends. This was especially evident when the senior product owner went on holiday and gave the reigns to the BA-cum-PO who was involved with the project from the start but was not properly briefed on the direction and priorities. The team ended spending a whole sprint spiking and implementing a solution for a feature that was never going to be part of the product.

Additionally, due to the factions within the team, each group started pulling away from the team and pursuing a different goal. The development process started resembling that of a classic waterfall model where there are a series of almost independent phases with work casually tossed over to the next group with minimal communication and care. 

####Transparency
The product owner was not part of the team, which I think is crucial in maintaining an open communication channel and ensuring availability and involvement. The product owners were disconnected and distant while the team felt they lacked urgency and were indifferent to the success of the project. They were not there to answer questions about the product nor share its direction with the rest of the team. User stories were not readied for planning and poorly written. 

Futhermore, these particular product owners failed to recognize how they fit in an agile team and started taking the mantle of old school project managers. They stopped discussing the direction of the product with the development team and started making decision and coming up with solutions within themselves. The relationship became akin to a military regiment with orders coming from the product directors than no one must dare to question. This, naturally, lead to, among other things, another colossal time waste as they came up with technically unfeasible solutions that the development team, to put it mildly picked enormous holes in. Technical people are hired to solve technical problems, therefore, it is crucial that POs/BAs present these problems to the team and give the developers ownership of the solutions. This does not mean that the POs should not be involved, it just emphasise that the POs should not provide solutions but engage the team in the technical problems they are trying to solve. Spotify, for example, recognises this and they simply present the problems to the teams who have complete control of how to fix it. Basically, people should be allowed to do the jobs they were hired to do.
