Agile practices preach transprancy within and outside a team. It build trust, empowers and motivates the team. In my exprience there is nothing more deflating and morale zapping to a team than lack of transparency and trust. In this post, I will present my views on a recent project that I worked on than I considered a failure, why I think it failed and lessons learned.

Around a year ago, I joined a company to work on a SaaS system case management system. This was a re-write of the company's flagship product as it has become a monumental piece of unmaintainable, inconrehinsible code and architecture. This meant the company could neither react to market changes nor bug fixes and updates. They resorted to actually asking customers to give them access to their production environements in order to "fix the issues". I have not seen the code myself but the tales of the ingenious hacks were almost legendary in the office. Additionally, new releases had to be done over the weekend and it took around two days to release a version of the software and it entailed numerous untraceable untestable manual steps. Furthermore, releases were generally buggy as the software had no kind of automated tests and was just tossed over to the QAs before release.

Needless to say, a complete re-write was unavoidable. But a mere code revision would likely be a long and winding road back to square one. What was really needed was an overhaul of the software practices and they way the business viewed software development, release management, product management, marketing, sales, etc. Thankfully, the business came to the same conclusion and started a recruitment drive to get the right people in. There were a lot of teething issues at the start but progress was slowly being made. 

I joined the company shortly after it started embracing agile so the developers that joined before me set the stage and commenced using Continuous Integration, Pair Programming, TDD, BDD as well as all the Scrum ceremonies. The benefits were great and it was felt, and appreciated, throughout the business. This was never more apparent than when an external evaluator visited the office to assess the conformity of an implementation we did to their contract. The external evaluator was running through a series of tests and marking them either passed/failed. The business was used to failing these kind of evaluations whenever there is a single failure as they were not equipped to fix the issues and re-release in a timely fashion. The team managed to make over 30 releases that day, fixng all the problem identified by the evaluator and passing the test. This was unheard of at this company and, hence, the business realised that there is method behind the madness and maybe, just maybe, these new recruits knew what they were doing. And that bought us valuable amount of leeway to take ownership of the upcoming re-write.

The re-write did not start off as smoothly as excpected. It was as if someone higher up was putting pressure to just start something as requirements were fuzzy at best. Developers were plucked away from other projects and basically told to sit in a room and come up with functional requirements on the fly for a system that, at that point in time, had no target industry, no locked-down set of functionality, no project plan, no functional requirements in terms of security, audit, performance, capacity, availability, reliability, etc... When pressed the product owners would just come up with unrealistic figures off the top of their heads.

Eventually, the product owners - like every naive non-technical PO/BA, decided that it is a good idea to play it safe, they reckoned, by demanding the maximum of everything. So the system should support hundreds of thousands of users, must have five nines (99.999%) availability, must be highly scalable, should have no downtime during release/updates and everything in the system should be configurable (including UI screens, workflows, etc..). Understandably, we pushed back very hard as building such a system, if it could be built, in the timescales proposed is nigh on impossible. We especially detested the "everything is configurable" requirement as this is the reason why we were doing this re-write in the first place. Anyway, we had to settle for a compromise as we could not just alter all the proposed requirements. Granted we should have pushed harder but the only functionality we were able to eliminate was the configurability.

Based on the above requirements, we decided Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) was a good fit as it would give us vertical scalability, allows us to support a very high number of users, eliminates downtime for releases, reduces time to market. This left us with the 99.999% availability, which meant that we cannot rely on a single cloud provider as none of them (at least none that I am aware of) give that guarantee. In light of that, we decided to not have any direct dependency on any of the cloud providers, hence, using Azure Service Bus or Azure Table Storage was out of the question.

Basically, the product requirements necessitated the architectural decisions and this was communicated to the buiness during the early phases of the project as well as during the the demonstrations at the end of every 2-week sprint. However, a lot of agile practitioners out there forget that in order of agile to work effectively, transparency should be considered a two-way street.
